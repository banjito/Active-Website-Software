Database Connections Setup and Verification PRD

Objective:
Set up and verify all database connections between the common, business, and neta_ops schemas in the Supabase database, replacing dummy data with actual database connections.

Current State:
- Web app is partially set up with dummy data
- Supabase connection is working
- Three schemas exist: common, business, and neta_ops
- Environment variables are properly configured

Requirements:

1. Schema Verification and Documentation
- Verify the structure and relationships between all three schemas
- Document the purpose and relationships of each schema
- Map out all table relationships across schemas
- Create a schema diagram showing cross-schema relationships

2. Database Connection Setup
- Implement proper schema selection in Supabase queries
- Set up cross-schema joins where needed
- Ensure proper error handling for schema-specific errors
- Implement connection pooling and optimization
- Add connection status monitoring

3. Data Migration
- Identify all components using dummy data
- Create migration scripts for each component
- Implement data validation
- Set up proper error handling for data type mismatches

4. Frontend Integration
- Update all components to use real database connections
- Implement proper loading states
- Add error handling for database connection issues
- Add retry mechanisms for failed connections
- Implement proper data caching

5. Testing and Verification
- Create test suite for database connections
- Implement connection monitoring
- Add logging for connection issues
- Create health check endpoints
- Set up automated testing for cross-schema queries

Technical Specifications:

1. Schema Structure:
- common: Shared tables and utilities
- business: Business-specific data and operations
- neta_ops: Operational data and metrics

2. Required Features:
- Real-time data updates
- Cross-schema query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Error recovery
- Data validation
- Cache management

3. Performance Requirements:
- Query response time < 200ms
- Connection establishment < 100ms
- Automatic retry on connection failure
- Cache hit ratio > 80%

4. Security Requirements:
- Proper schema-level access control
- Data validation before cross-schema operations
- Audit logging for schema access
- Error handling without exposing schema details

Dependencies:
- Supabase client library
- Existing schema structures
- Frontend components currently using dummy data
- Environment variables configuration
