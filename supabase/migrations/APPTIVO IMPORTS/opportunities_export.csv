My name Is Joey Benscoter, I’m with ESSE as well - Eric Inman shot over your contact info and I was hoping you may be able to help us out with a project we have in Atlanta.  
   
Project Name &amp; Location:  

903 Peachtree  
903 peachtree st, atlanta ga  

   
Equipment:  

500kW Generac Generator with an upsized alternator (600kW), diesel, 480v, 3ph  
Fire Pump – 150hp Firetrol, the controller is an FTA1930,  

Told by firetrol this is a soft start  


   
Summary:  

So we’ve been working to get this generator to function with the fire pump for a little while now and have exhausted all the settings and manipulations we can.  Long story short, the gen can pickup the fire pump when you simulate an outage, however when you manually test the fire pump on generator it fails.  (exceeds the 15% voltage dip).  We’ve gotten the gen to pass on the building with resistive load, which we assume would be cleaning up the power factor on the fire pump motor…  

   
What we need:  

I want to get a power quality test done on the gen, as well as the fire pump to ensure both are operating properly.  What we’re thinking is the fire pump may not be hitting this generator with a soft start which is pushing it past the voltage dip limit.  

   
Please feel free to give me a shout to discuss this, we’re under a little pressure from the GC, EE, and EC to try and facilitate a resolution as quickly as we can.  
  

Brian- Generator is probably not sized to safely run the fire pump. in an outage it tries and works. In manual the settings prevent operation. Just a guess. I would look for separate setting files.

Could also be that that the soft start operates differently depending on how it is initiated.

7/7- William spoke with Jordan over the phone. He needs the terms as soon as we can get them, Inline's order was delayed until September. Field Services began looking for Terminations.
 
7/8- Received quotes back from Cape Electric and Elecktrik for the termination kits. Cape was cheaper by  $22.95 and can get them from one of their other offices in a week. Elektrik has them in stock if needed. I have quoted at the higher rate in case they need them faster than a week.
 
7/8- Jordan approved the quote and requested these ASAP so we will go with Elektrik for the faster lead time.","07/08/2025","William Sasser","Letter Proposal","100.0","3725","07/08/2025","120","11/05/2025","$0.0",,"$0.0","2","1",,,,"Jul 08, 2025 10:33:11 AM","Jul 08, 2025 03:32:40 PM","William Sasser","Ethan Thoenes","Not Contacted"
